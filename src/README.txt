Goal of Application: to view and filter/sort through a list of restaurants
Link: https://lazyelephant420.github.io/development/
Components:
    - App.js --> components folder:
        - FilterUser.js/FilterRating.js/SortRating.js all have to do with sorting and FilterRating
        - Sidebar has to do with the sidebar capabilities
        - Restaurants receive a list of filtered/sorted items and lists them in the sidebar
        - Topbar.js deals with the top header
Usability Principles: I used this layout to represent a heirarchy for the different files present. App.js
mainly just works with the map component and the other components have to do with decorating this main App component.
